# Progress

## Branches

- `master`: original roadmap and verified research milestones.
- `development`: active investigation and implementation.

## 2026-10-08 — first reverse engineering pass

Completed:

- Established and pushed `master` and `development` to the requested GitHub repository.
- Inventoried 18 Xcode preview binaries/archives and 8 OS SDK stubs.
- Recorded hashes, UUIDs, load commands, symbols, demangled Swift signatures, and strings locally.
- Built runtime metadata dumper; inspected OS and host frameworks in separate processes.
- Identified `UVPropertyList` and XPC coding adapters.
- Verified synthetic binary-plist serialization and native message-key getters.
- Recovered bitmap, render, layer-host, launch, stream identity, and JIT loading interfaces.
- Added reproducible collection, disassembly, runtime dump, and Ghidra scripts.
- Decompiled seven selected functions in Ghidra and saved the local project. Full automatic analysis hit its 120-second limit; selected function decompilations succeeded.
- Verified all collection commands, isolated runtime loads, native getter results, and independent Python binary-plist decoding.

Next:

- Trace a minimal native macOS preview session and capture message envelopes.
- Recover exact raw discriminants, replies, version negotiation, and surface transfer.
- Define a separately named portable protocol only after identifying the required semantics.

Not yet implemented: Rust preview core, SwiftUI compatibility layer, WASM compilation/runtime, renderer, bindings, or portable preview MCP server. The research-tool MCP server is implemented in the subsequent milestone. Nothing in this milestone establishes end-to-end preview compatibility.

## 2026-10-08 — free agentic RE toolkit

Implemented:

- Bounded serial executor with a reviewed eight-experiment queue, strict adapter validation, dependency selection and exclusive ownership.
- Frozen worker source copies, per-run manifests/journals, SHA-256 verification, atomic checkpoints, interruption recovery, time/artifact budgets and owned-process cleanup.
- Local stdio MCP server exposing discovery, status, ready work, bounded execution, proposal validation, evidence verification and report candidates.
- GhidraVibe service management, schema discovery, engine health checks, optional stdio bridge and reviewed read-tool allowlist; isolated direct headless analysis remains available.
- Frida 17 tracing of six owned native calls and six synthetic `UVPropertyList` outputs; independent payload decoding verifies values with zero script errors.
- LLDB tracing of six owned calls with matching arguments and loaded-image identities.
- SwiftUI native reference capture, PNG differential checking and a data-preserving plist decoder.
- Free pinned Python dependencies installed locally; no paid analysis API required.
- Xcode's installed MCP bridge discovery helper. Discovery reports no running Xcode instance on this machine; no settings were changed.
- Full [loop design](docs/reverse-engineering/agentic-loop.md), [operator prompt](docs/reverse-engineering/agentic-loop-prompt.md) and [tool/setup matrix](docs/reverse-engineering/toolkit.md).

Validation: 19 automated tests pass. Real-tool validation includes the native debugger, Frida hook/payload capture, SwiftUI PNG rendering, collection/runtime/disassembly, healthy GhidraVibe engine with 70 advertised tools, real HTTP dyld-cache discovery and stdio MCP bridge calls, and two selected saved Ghidra decompilations. Full Ghidra automatic analysis remains partial at its configured 120-second limit. All eight seeded experiments passed and all sealed artifact hashes verified; see the [toolkit evidence index](research/evidence/agentic-toolkit-2026-10-08.json).

Next: open an owned fixture in Xcode, discover its enabled MCP preview tools, then capture one actual canvas lifecycle with correlated request/reply and output resources. The existing synthetic trace and ImageRenderer reference do not establish a live wire protocol. XPC attachment lifetimes, replay, portable SwiftUI/WASM and the Rust renderer remain open.

## 2026-10-08 — connected analysis and exact verification

Implemented:

- Live schema-driven Ghidra program queries and repository-owned import/function preparation; six Frida events joined by image hash, Mach-O UUID and function offset to decompilation/disassembly/references.
- Bounded static Swift nominal/field metadata reader: 351 types and 998 fields on the pinned image; unresolved symbolic/indirect references remain unknown.
- Typed differential plist corpus, exact streaming byte/bit comparisons, cross-process repeatability checks and deterministic semantic failure shrinking.
- Three small synthetic native goldens with original inputs, Apple reference bytes, hashes, probe provenance and a sealed-run manifest anchor.
- Evidence SQLite/FTS index and graph, exact artifact/response paging, scoped claims, and reviewed counterexperiment templates. MCP now exposes 19 tools; large responses retain full local originals.
- External manifest anchor verification, changed-input detection, frozen-source verification and comparison-time integrity checks. Self-consistency alone is explicitly not authentication.
- Owned macOS Xcode project and real canvas adapter with exact project selection, source/build preflight, controlled variants and mapping-verified late instrumentation. Mutable Xcode workspaces stay outside frozen sources and sealed artifacts.

Validation: 40 automated tests pass. Native connected/static experiments pass. Seed seven passes 24 cases; reviewed seed-eight follow-up passes 32 cases. In each campaign, repeated calls, fresh objects, Foundation encoding and a second helper process produce identical Apple bytes for every case; independent Python decoding preserves typed values. Python encoding matches Apple in only six cases per campaign, so semantic round trips do not establish encoder byte compatibility. System `cmp` checks a published native golden, and MCP comparison rejects a 49-byte Unicode encoding difference.

Canvas status: the owned native project builds successfully after disabling its stalled SDK stat-cache optimization. Xcode MCP then times out on `tools/list`. Earlier attempts exposed source-group lookup and active-scheme issues. No real canvas snapshot or complete correlated IPC capture is claimed. The verifier also detected Xcode updating workspace UI state after sealing and quarantined that run. The final adapter moves active workspaces outside sealed artifacts; isolation is unit-tested. Preserve diagnostics; diagnose bridge responsiveness before another expensive render attempt. The controller recommends diagnosis rather than unchanged retries.

See the [machine-readable evidence and manifest anchors](research/evidence/connected-verification-2026-10-08.json), [golden fixtures](tools/re/fixtures/PlistOracle/manifest.json), and [verification/edge-case/porting contract](docs/reverse-engineering/verification.md). All successful measurements retain their exact frozen tool versions locally. Raw Apple binaries, full decompilation, private metadata and active Xcode workspace state are excluded from publication.

Next: restore reliable Xcode MCP schema responses, obtain A/A and controlled A/B canvas captures, then recover a complete transport envelope and attachment lifecycle before implementing replay or claiming portable preview compatibility.

## 2026-10-08 — recursive XPC boundary recovery

Four new sealed experiments pass: 32 local XPC dictionary round trips with exact payload/property-data and cross-process byte equality; malformed-envelope controls; all 105 prefixes of a 104-byte Unicode plist; and ten statically recovered message raw strings corroborated against Swift metadata. A cross-adapter comparison matches the prior published Unicode oracle byte for byte, with zero differing bits.

Nonempty truncated native data decodes as an empty dictionary; missing/wrong-type/empty XPC fields return nil. Direct empty NSData also decodes empty. Shrinking reduces the fallback reproducer to one input key. A published eight-byte synthetic malformed golden preserves the native/strict-Python decoder difference.

The serial controller now has 16 adapters and 19 MCP tools. All 52 automated tests pass; all four final runs retain verified artifacts and frozen sources. Earlier harness failures remain sealed and inconclusive. Evidence indexing and scoped claims consume the final runs; the planner follows observed failures without duplicating queued work.

Three bounded bridge diagnostics still time out on Xcode MCP tools/list after successful initialization, including with the owned project open and a fresh pinned session. No real canvas image, live wire envelope or resource-transfer compatibility is claimed. Continue with a responsive capture path and live validation of the static strings, then recover attachments and lifecycle semantics.

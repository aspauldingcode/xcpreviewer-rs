# Progress

## Branches

- `master`: original roadmap and verified research milestones.
- `development`: active investigation and implementation.

## 2026-10-08 — first reverse engineering pass

Completed:

- Established and pushed `master` and `development` to the requested GitHub repository.
- Inventoried 18 Xcode preview binaries/archives and 8 OS SDK stubs.
- Recorded hashes, UUIDs, load commands, symbols, demangled Swift signatures, and strings locally.
- Built runtime metadata dumper; inspected OS and host frameworks in separate processes.
- Identified `UVPropertyList` and XPC coding adapters.
- Verified synthetic binary-plist serialization and native message-key getters.
- Recovered bitmap, render, layer-host, launch, stream identity, and JIT loading interfaces.
- Added reproducible collection, disassembly, runtime dump, and Ghidra scripts.
- Decompiled seven selected functions in Ghidra and saved the local project. Full automatic analysis hit its 120-second limit; selected function decompilations succeeded.
- Verified all collection commands, isolated runtime loads, native getter results, and independent Python binary-plist decoding.

Next:

- Trace a minimal native macOS preview session and capture message envelopes.
- Recover exact raw discriminants, replies, version negotiation, and surface transfer.
- Define a separately named portable protocol only after identifying the required semantics.

Not yet implemented: Rust preview core, SwiftUI compatibility layer, WASM compilation/runtime, renderer, bindings, or portable preview MCP server. The research-tool MCP server is implemented in the subsequent milestone. Nothing in this milestone establishes end-to-end preview compatibility.

## 2026-10-08 — free agentic RE toolkit

Implemented:

- Bounded serial executor with a reviewed eight-experiment queue, strict adapter validation, dependency selection and exclusive ownership.
- Frozen worker source copies, per-run manifests/journals, SHA-256 verification, atomic checkpoints, interruption recovery, time/artifact budgets and owned-process cleanup.
- Local stdio MCP server exposing discovery, status, ready work, bounded execution, proposal validation, evidence verification and report candidates.
- GhidraVibe service management, schema discovery, engine health checks, optional stdio bridge and reviewed read-tool allowlist; isolated direct headless analysis remains available.
- Frida 17 tracing of six owned native calls and six synthetic `UVPropertyList` outputs; independent payload decoding verifies values with zero script errors.
- LLDB tracing of six owned calls with matching arguments and loaded-image identities.
- SwiftUI native reference capture, PNG differential checking and a data-preserving plist decoder.
- Free pinned Python dependencies installed locally; no paid analysis API required.
- Xcode's installed MCP bridge discovery helper. Discovery reports no running Xcode instance on this machine; no settings were changed.
- Full [loop design](docs/reverse-engineering/agentic-loop.md), [operator prompt](docs/reverse-engineering/agentic-loop-prompt.md) and [tool/setup matrix](docs/reverse-engineering/toolkit.md).

Validation: 19 automated tests pass. Real-tool validation includes the native debugger, Frida hook/payload capture, SwiftUI PNG rendering, collection/runtime/disassembly, healthy GhidraVibe engine with 70 advertised tools, real HTTP dyld-cache discovery and stdio MCP bridge calls, and two selected saved Ghidra decompilations. Full Ghidra automatic analysis remains partial at its configured 120-second limit. All eight seeded experiments passed and all sealed artifact hashes verified; see the [toolkit evidence index](research/evidence/agentic-toolkit-2026-10-08.json).

Next: open an owned fixture in Xcode, discover its enabled MCP preview tools, then capture one actual canvas lifecycle with correlated request/reply and output resources. The existing synthetic trace and ImageRenderer reference do not establish a live wire protocol. XPC attachment lifetimes, replay, portable SwiftUI/WASM and the Rust renderer remain open.
